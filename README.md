## Overview

We‚Äôre entering the **era of experience**, where large language models (LLMs) learn not just from static datasets, but from *interactive experience* gathered in complex, expressive environments.

As a step toward this, we introduce **GEM** ‚Äî a **G**eneral **E**xperience **M**aker for LLMs ‚Äî an open-source environment suite designed for training *agentic LLMs* via online reinforcement learning.

Like [OpenAI Gym](https://github.com/openai/gym) for traditional RL, GEM provides a standardized API and a growing collection of diverse environments. It is **training framework-agnostic** and supports seamless integration with six popular RL training frameworks including [Oat](https://github.com/sail-sg/oat) and [Tinker](https://github.com/thinking-machines-lab/tinker), offering:

* üß© Clean, composable environment APIs
* ‚öôÔ∏è Async vectorized execution for high-throughput simulation
* üîß Tool integration & custom wrappers
* üß† Multi-environment training
* üéà Ready-to-use benchmark environments and algorithms

## Installation

```bash
pip install -U gem-llm
```

Or install from source for the latest version:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/axon-rl/gem.git
cd gem
pip install -e .
```

Please check [Getting Started](./GETTING_STARTED.md) for more setup details.

üî• You can jump into [examples](./examples/) to quickly start your agentic RL training with GEM & your favorite training framework.

## Interface
GEM's interface closely follows OpenAI-Gym's API. Here's an example using the `game:GuessTheNumber-v0` environment: 

```python 
import gem

# List all supported environments
gem.print_envs()

# Initialize the environment
env = gem.make("game:GuessTheNumber-v0")

# Reset the environment to generate the first observation
observation, info = env.reset()

# Start the agent-environment loop
while True:
    action = env.sample_random_action() # insert policy here, e.g.,
    # (pseudocode) action = llm.generate(observation)

    # apply action and receive next observation, reward
    # and whether the episode has ended
    next_observation, reward, terminated, truncated, info = env.step(action)
    print("OBS", observation)
    print("ACT", action)

    # update the policy (online) here
    # e.g., policy = learn(policy, observation, action, reward, info)

    observation = next_observation
    # Exit when the episode terminates
    if terminated or truncated:
        break
```

## Features

1. Environments consist of tasks and (optional) tools. Tool-calling is achieved via an environment wrapper, as demonstrated [here](./GETTING_STARTED.md#tool-integration-examples).
2. GEM is training framework-agnostic, and we demonstrate its integration with six popular RL training frameworks.
3. We provide implementations and benchmarking results for different algorithms across a diverse set of environments.
