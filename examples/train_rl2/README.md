## Training with RL2

[RL2](https://github.com/ChenmienTan/RL2) is supported as the RL framework to integrate with GEM.

Next, we provide example command lines to run experiments for training LLMs to perform math, code, language games, and general QA, as well as to use tools like Python or search for them.

You can use the scripts:
- `run_count_letter.sh`
- `run_guess_number.sh`

for reasoning-gym and game environments respectively.
